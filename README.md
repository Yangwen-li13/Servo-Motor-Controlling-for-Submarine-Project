# Servo-Motor-Controlling-for-Submarine-Project
This work is from my internship at <b>METU-ROMER (Center for Robotics and AI) </b> .<br>
With the guidance of the researcher Atakan DURMAZ, We constructed a submarine that moves by wave movement of the fin.<br>
In this project, I just looked at the side of motor controlling and ensuring the correctness of moving motors in the water. I am writing this repository to access people who want to use servo motors as sinusoidal waves.

#### Hardware-Mechanical Side
I just connected the motors to the module and chose the most appropriate voltage and current values. All my work is in Guide.pdf. You can adjust the system by looking at it if you are confused with this step.

#### Coding Side
