# Servo-Motor-Controlling-for-Submarine-Project
This work is from my internship at <b>METU-ROMER (Center for Robotics and AI) </b> .<br>
With the guidance of the researcher Atakan DURMAZ, We constructed a submarine that moves by wave movement of the fin.<br>
In this project, I just looked at the side of motor controlling and ensuring the correctness of moving motors in the water. I am writing this repository to access people who want to use servo motors as sinusoidal waves.

#### Hardware-Mechanical Side
I just connected the motors to the module and chose the most appropriate voltage and current values. All my work is in Guide.pdf. You can adjust the system by looking at it if you are confused with this step.

#### Coding Side
This part is hard to explain because coding depends on the people themselves, it is like explaining what you feel for any art piece :). However, before you get into coding, look at the Adafruit-PWM-Servo-Driver-Library that I used in my codes. You can also find it in Others/Servo Motor SÃ¼rme. <br>
For other documents, I give a number for each of them choreographically. You can examine them according to numbers. <br>
As a last thing, I should mention that we added some extra changes in our model based on the project, so never mind these parts.
